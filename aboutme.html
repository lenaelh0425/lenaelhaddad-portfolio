        <h10>I am a fourth-year student at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario. 
            Give it one more year, and I'll have a Bachelor's in Media Production and Design. 
            I wish I could give you a straightforward answer to what my program is, but the truth is, it's basically learning every possible way to tell a story. 
            My favourites that we have learned so far are Multimedia Design, Videography, and UX/UI design. 
            I've found that Web development is definitely one of the more challenging ones, so I'm really proud that I managed to code this website completely! 
            This photo is me in Montreal after planning a spontaneous last-minute trip, but I've been to cooler places, ask me about them (not that Canada isn't super duper cool 😜).
